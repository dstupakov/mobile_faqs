      <div class="faq_answer_container">
        <div class="faq_answer">Your privacy is very important to Propeller, and we value your privacy. Your information will never be sold, and your personally identifiable information, such as full name and email address, will never be revealed to others without your consent. The company’s privacy practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected online and how that information is used are explained in our <a href="http://propellerhealth.com/privacy/">privacy policy</a>.</div>

    <div class="faq_question">Does the sensor mean you can monitor where I am? Or my child? </div>
      <div class="faq_answer_container">
        <div class="faq_answer">No. Not to worry, this is not a big brother scenario. Think about your sensor as snapping a photo each time you use the inhaler – a photo of date, time, and location data when paired with your mobile device. Location data from your inhaler usages is not shared with anyone unless you give permission, such as choosing to share your asthma or COPD data with a family member or healthcare provider.</div>

      <div class="faq_answer_container">
        <div class="faq_answer">Yes. You can disable location settings for the Propeller mobile app via your general settings on your phone. When location services are disabled, the app will still keep track of the date and time that you use your inhaler, but it will not collect any location information.

      <div class="faq_answer_container">
        <div class="faq_answer">No, other Propeller users cannot view your data. If you opt in to share anonymized location data, no personal information will ever be shared, and your trends and locations will be aggregated and anonymized within your local community so nothing can ever be linked to an individual. A user can see, for example, that the area between 3<sup>rd</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> streets downtown is a hot spot for attacks, but they can’t see who has been having problems there. We are also careful to aggregate hot spots to include multiple users so that no hot spot could be traced back to an individual’s home or work location.</div>
